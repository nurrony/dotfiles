# Nur Rony's Dotfiles

My dotfiles :smile: for Zsh on **MacOS**. Clone the repository and Run `setup.sh` to setup some initial requirements

My most favourite parts are `.functions` and `.dockerfunctions`

### Installation

To get all done in a minutes you can use the [setup script](https://github.com/nmrony/dotfiles/blob/master/setup) script

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmrony/dotfiles/master/setup | bash
```

### Customization

Do not forget to edit git username and email in `.extra` and `.gitconfig` with yours.

**Happy Hacking!!**

### Developers macOS defaults (?) :wink:

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:

```sh
./.macos
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common Homebrew formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```sh
./brew.sh
```
### Vim Editior Setup

To setup Vim Editor, symlink/copy just `.vimrc` into your `HOME` directory and run `vim` command once.

### Terminal theme and tweaks

I use **iTerm2** and **Zsh** together and **[PowerLevel10k][1]** as theme.
You need to install these followings to get look like my terminal theme

1. [Shade of Purple for iTerm2][2]
1. [MesloLGS NF Regular][3] - Font size: 16

You can import my settings from [iterm2][4] directory
