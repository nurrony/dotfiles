  There is a brew.sh and .macos script which makes your Mac
  more friendly for development. I highly recommend to take
  a look into those files. Please do CHECK and ADD/EDIT those
  files before running.

  INFORMATION: Please create .extra in you HOME directory to override or for customizing configurations
